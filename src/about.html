            <p>
            This overlayed choropleth map is a model of the risk of accidents in NYC. Each polygon on the <br/>
            map is representative of zip code boundary. The coloring of each region is representative of the <br/>
            accident density for the associated zip code. The accident density is a metric of the number of <br/>
            accidents per mile of roadway in the zipcode. That accident density score for each zip code is then <br/>
            normalized on a scale of 0 to 100. You can see that the darkest red region, with an accident density <br/>
            score of 100, is located in Manhatten, the area of NYC with the most traffic. You can also see that <br/>
            zip code that is the lightest color, a transparent white color, is located on the outskirts of <br/>
            Island. <br/>
            You can find in the top right part of the screen, a information box, which allows the user to chose <br/>
            a start and end location to route a drive. Once selected, the fastest route between the two locations <br/>
            is overlayed on top of the map. Once the user selects the start and end locations, metrics about the <br/>
            trip are displayed in the three other text boxes, located within the same information box. The metrics <br/>
            are as follows: score, represents the aggregate risk associated with the trip (i.e a 1 mile trip through <br/>
            a zipcode with score 50 would equal a 2 mile trip through a zipcode with score 25); distance, the length <br/>
            of the trip from start to end; risk level, the risk level bracket that the trip falls into, calculated <br/>
            by dividing the aggregate score by the route distance. <br/>
            On the bottom right part of the screen, you can find a information box which changes as you hover your <br/>
            cursor over each zipcode region. The information displayed in the box is the zipcodes actual code (i.e <br/>
            01609) and the total number of reported accidents in that zipcode for the year of 2017. <br/>
            Additionally, since this visualization was built using Google's Maps API, the user can use the built in <br/>
            functionality of google maps, like toggling between the street level map and the satellite view or toggling <br/>
            between showing the labels and the terrain for the map.

            <h3><p>Motivation</p></h3>
            <p>
            The visualization has potential to help many different agents. It could be helpful for city planners to <br/>
            understand how to better mitigate the risk of accidents with deiciding which zipcodes need more risk <br/>
            mitigation. Inusrance companies could also use this tool to analyze the trips of their insured drivers <br/>
            to better understand the risk they are assuming when the driver gets behind the wheel.
